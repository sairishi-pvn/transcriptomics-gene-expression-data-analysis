# Transcriptomics Gene Expression Data Analysis

This repository contains multiple workflows and scripts related to
gene expression analysis in transcriptomics, including RNA-seq and
microarray-based approaches.

## Scope
- RNA-seq differential expression analysis
- Microarray (Affymetrix) gene expression analysis
- Data normalization, filtering, and visualization
- Statistical testing using Bioconductor tools

## Tools & Technologies
- R
- Bioconductor
- edgeR
- limma
- affy

- ## Repository Structure
- `.R` scripts contain individual analysis workflows
- `.csv` files contain example gene expression datasets

## Purpose
This repository serves as a learning and portfolio project for
transcriptomics and bioinformatics data analysis.
